Smart Plant Growth System

Problem Description : The idea is to check the quality of water and quality of soil using sensors and
recommending suitable crops for better growth.

Overview:- The Smart Plant Growth Monitoring System is a cutting-edge technology designed to revolutionize the way plants are cultivated and cared for. This system integrates sensors, data analytics, and automation to provide real-time insights into the health and growth of plants. Key components include environmental sensors to measure factors like temperature, humidity,  as well as soil moisture sensors  and water sensors.
By considering these factors a suitable crop will be proposed.

Key Features:
1.The Nitrogen ,Potassium and Phosphorous level of the soil  will be measured using the soil sensor .
2.These measured level is then compared with the ideal levels of the nutrients for which the soil is said to be suitable for plant growth.
3.The quality of water using water sensor is measured.
4.Comparing these data ,a suitable crop will be suggested through a web application.
5.This helps farmers to choose the correct crop and yield more benefit.

Advantages:-
Currently , We only have a chemical approach for soil testing,
Smart agriculture has to be successfully implemented for betterment of farmers by checking the real time values of nutrients of soil and humidity.
Selecting the crop based on the water and  soil quality will result in better yield.
This approach can be used by the general public to enter agriculture.

Conclusions:-
1.The Idea seems to be simple but it consist of lot of benefits for a rural
development and agriculture.
2.When the idea is developed to a prototype lot of improvements can be  made and can successfully yield more benefit
